// Notes:
// ---------------
// ! means macro
// let keyword for variables
//
// variables are immutable by default. 'mut' makes it mutable

// String is a string type provided by the standard library
// that is a growable, utf-8 encoded bit of text

// The :: syntax in the ::new line indicates that new is
// an associated function of the String type. An associated
// function is implemented on a type, in this case String
// Like a static method

// io::stdin() is a handle to the stdin of the terminal
// & is a referenc, which gives you a way to let multiple
// parts of your code access one piece of data without needing
// to copy that data into memory multiple times
// references are immutable by default

// The Result types are enumerations, often referred to as enums.
// An enumeration is a type that can have a fixed set of values,
// and those values are called the enumâ€™s variants.
